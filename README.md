# Cayman Theme for @paulavery/docs
This repository contains the default theme for the [@paulavery/docs](http://npmjs.com/package/@paulavery/docs) documentation generator.

It is based on the [Cayman](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme) theme by Jason Long which was modified to allow nested documentation pages.

An example of this theme can be found [here](https://paulavery.github.io/docs/).
